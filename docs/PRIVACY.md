# Privacy and CROPS

Varada aims to meet the Ethereum Foundation's CROPS properties: **C**ensorship resistance,
**O**pen source, **P**rivacy and **S**ecurity. This document covers how the web app keeps what a
user looks at private, what it cannot protect, and where each CROPS property stands today.

## Private RPC (anon-rpc)

Every chain read the web app makes goes through [anon-rpc](https://github.com/ethereum/anon-rpc).
anon-rpc runs an anonymizing network client inside a sandboxed worker in the browser, and the app
sends its RPC requests through that client. The default client is Hisoka's Nox mixnet; Nym and Tor
are a configuration switch.

### What it protects

When a user views data tied to their address, such as a portfolio, donations made or votes cast:

- **The RPC provider never sees the user's IP address.** Requests leave the mixnet from an exit
  node, so the provider sees the exit's address, not the user's.
- **Varada never sees the request at all.** Account data is read from the chain in the browser,
  never from the Varada indexer, and the web app never sends a user's address to Varada servers.
- **A user's accounts cannot be linked to each other through their queries.** Each address gets
  its own random isolation key, which asks the network to keep that address's traffic unlinkable
  from other addresses' traffic. Keys exist only in memory and change on every page load.
- **Account queries never fall back to a direct connection.** If the anonymizing network is down,
  account data does not load. The user can choose to load *public* data (token lists, epochs)
  directly, but that choice never applies to account-scoped requests.

Without this, an RPC provider (Infura, Alchemy or a public endpoint) could record "IP X looked up
the donations and votes of address Y". Over time that ties a person's location and identity to
their whole on-chain history.

### How it works

| Piece | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `src/lib/private-rpc.ts` | `PrivateRpc` | Owns the anon-rpc worker, isolation keys, fail-closed policy and the viem transport. |
| `src/lib/account-reads.ts` | `createAccountClient` | The only sanctioned way to read address-keyed data. |
| `src/lib/wagmi.ts` | wagmi transport | wagmi reads go through the private RPC, isolated under the connected account. |
| `src/lib/chain-reads.ts` | `createChainClient` | Public-scope chain reads (the indexer fallback). |
| `src/components/privacy-status.tsx` | header | Shows connection state, allows a retry, and lets the user route indexer traffic privately too. |

The harness checks the worker bundle against a keccak256 hash pinned in an on-chain specifier
contract, and only then runs it. The worker runs in a Web Worker inside a null-origin iframe with
no access to the page, cookies, storage or keys.

Configure it in `config.json` under `privateRpc`, or with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANON_RPC_NETWORK` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_RPC_URLS` variables:

```json
{
  "privateRpc": {
    "network": "nox",
    "rpcUrls": ["https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com", "https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc"]
  }
}
```

For Nym, set `"network": "nym"`. For Tor, set `"network": "tor-js"` and give a `workerConfig` with
`gateways`; run your own gateway, the published one is a demonstration.

Nox's specifier contract lives on Sepolia (Hisoka has not published a mainnet one yet), so for Nox
the bootstrap read goes to a public Sepolia RPC (`bootstrapRpcUrl` overrides the built-in list),
while the anonymized reads themselves still go to the mainnet RPCs above. The app refuses to start
a worker when the bootstrap RPC serves a different chain than the specifier's.

### Measured cost

Measured in Chrome on 2026-11-05 through Nym; Nox has not been measured in this app yet:

- The worker was ready about 8 seconds after start.
- Each `eth_blockNumber` took about 6 seconds.

`ethereum.reth.rs` and `publicnode.com` answered. Llamarpc (HTTP 525) and Cloudflare refused
mixnet traffic. The app batches JSON-RPC calls and lists several RPCs for failover. The worker
starts on the first chain read, or straight away once a wallet connects.

### What it does not protect

- **Transactions.** Votes, launches and donations are signed and broadcast by the user's wallet
  through the wallet's own RPC, which this app does not control. That RPC sees the signed
  transaction and the user's IP. Users who want this hidden should set a private or
  Tor-routed RPC in their wallet.
- **On-chain data is public.** anon-rpc hides who is asking, not what is on-chain. A ballot's
  voter and weight are public; the choice is encrypted (Zama FHEVM through `IVotingScheme`) and
  only per-option totals are ever decrypted. With very few voters the totals can still reveal a
  choice.
- **The Zama relayer.** Encrypting a ballot fetches the FHE public key and an input proof from
  Zama's relayer directly (the SDK has no fetch hook, so this cannot go through anon-rpc). The
  relayer sees the IP, the scheme address and the voter address, never the choice. Operators can
  put a proxy in front with `zamaRelayerUrl`.
- **The bootstrap read.** A few direct calls read the specifier contract (on Sepolia for Nox,
  mainnet for Nym and Tor), and the worker bundle is downloaded from the specifier's resolver.
  These reveal only that this IP is starting an anon-rpc worker.
- **The worker itself.** The worker sees every read it carries, and it could lie or drop requests.
  Trust rests with whoever controls the specifier contract (Hisoka for the default Nox, the Nym
  project for Nym).
  The pinned hash makes that code auditable and stops silent substitution.
- **Site delivery.** The ENS or Swarm gateway that serves the page sees the page load. Token
  logos and asset packs (such as stock logos) load from the configured Swarm read gateway, which
  sees which images a page shows, never a wallet address.
- **Indexer traffic, unless routed.** Public pages read the Varada indexer directly by default.
  The indexer sees the IP and which token pages were viewed while serving the request, but never
  a wallet address, and it keeps no access logs. Users can
  turn on "Also route Varada API requests" to hide their IP from Varada as well.

## Trades and holders

- **Public on chain regardless.** Every swap and token transfer names its addresses on chain.
  The indexer keeps them so a token page can show its trade feed (`trader` is the transaction
  sender) and its largest holders with their share of supply, as any block explorer does.
- **No address lookups.** The trade and holder routes take a token address only. There is no
  "trades of address X" or "balance of address X" route; a "my trades" view filters the public
  feed in the browser, and a balance is read through `createAccountClient`.

## Swaps

- **Pool reads are public.** Prices, pool state, fees and quotes (`StateView`, the V4 quoter) carry no
  address and use the public client.
- **Address-keyed reads are private.** Balances, Permit2 allowances and the Ondo blocklist check of the
  connected address go through `createAccountClient`, so neither Varada nor the RPC provider sees the
  address with the user's IP. The trade code never sends an address to the indexer.
- **Signing and sending are the wallet's.** The Permit2 permit is signed in the wallet and travels
  inside the swap transaction; the swap is broadcast by the wallet's own RPC, which sees it (see
  "What it does not protect"). Gas is estimated through the private RPC under the account's key.
- Details of routing and execution: [`SWAP.md`](SWAP.md).

## Curator agents and paid data

### Donations to agent vaults (opt-in credit)

- **Public on chain regardless.** A donation is a transaction from the donor's wallet.
  `AgentVault.Donated(from, amount, credit)` carries `from` whatever `credit` says, and USDC's
  `Transfer` event names the sender too. Opting out of credit does not hide a donor from anyone
  reading the chain; it only decides whether Varada names them.
- **What Varada stores and shows.** The indexer stores the donor address only when `credit` is
  true; otherwise the row keeps the amount, time and transaction hash with no donor.
  `/api/agents/:label` lists credited donations only, and the agent pages show those donors and the
  totals, which include every donation. Plain USDC transfers to a vault emit no `Donated` event and
  are not attributed at all.
- Donating is a wallet transaction like any other write, so the wallet's RPC sees it (see
  "What it does not protect").

### Live-donation feed entries

- `LiveDonationVault.Donated(token, causeId, org, amount, orgDeployed, inSwap)` names no donor: the
  vault pays from the swap fees of a token, not from a person. The `live_donation` activity kind
  (`/api/activity`, `/api/activity/stream`) carries only the token, cause, org, amount and flags,
  so it adds no address of anyone who traded. The swapper stays visible only in the separate
  public `trade` rows, which already exist.

### x402 payers

- **No accounts.** Buyers of the paid routes need no sign-up, API key or session; each request
  carries its own payment.
- **What the indexer sees.** The payment header is the payer's signed EIP-3009 authorization, so
  while serving a paid request the indexer sees the payer's address together with the request's
  IP. It stores neither: there is no payment table and no ALB access log. Paid responses are
  `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
- **What is recorded: the settlement only.** The settlement is a public USDC transfer from the
  payer to the platform treasury on Base or Ethereum mainnet, which shows that the address paid
  Varada at that time; the amount can hint at which route was bought. Base settlements are also
  recorded by Coinbase CDP under its own policies. Mainnet settlements are logged by the
  publisher's facilitator (outcome, transaction hash, error reason). The facilitators receive the
  payment from the indexer, never the buyer's IP. Buyers who do not want purchases tied to their
  other activity should pay from a fresh address.

### Curator reports

- **Public by design.** Reports are uploaded to Swarm, their picks roots and `reportRef` are on
  chain, and the indexer serves them free, so anyone can check how a ballot was built. A report
  cannot be retracted once its reference is on chain; it stays retrievable while its postage
  stamp lasts.
- Reports name organisations and link public news. They carry no data about donors, voters or
  site visitors. News text the agents read is untrusted data: it can shape a ranking but is never
  followed as instructions.

## Rules for new features

1. Never send a user's address to the Varada indexer or any other server. Read account data
   with `createAccountClient(rpc, address)`, or fetch public data and filter it in the browser.
2. Do not create viem clients with a plain `http()` transport. Use `rpc.transport(scope)`.
3. Do not add analytics, third-party fonts, CDNs or tracking. The app makes no third-party
   requests apart from the RPCs and the anon-rpc bootstrap.
4. `EventSource` cannot use a custom fetch. When indexer traffic is routed privately, use
   `subscribeActivity(..., { sse: false })`.
5. Name a donor only when they opted in (`credit`). Totals may count everyone; lists and pages
   show credited donors only, and nothing stores an uncredited donor's address.
6. The web app never calls the `/x402` routes. A payment header carries the payer's address,
   which rule 1 forbids sending; the paid routes are for outside buyers.
7. Paid features must not add accounts or store anything about a buyer beyond the settlement.
8. Curator reports and agent pages carry no personal data about private individuals. Treat news
   and other fetched text as untrusted input.

## CROPS assessment

Status as of 2026-11-07. Gaps are listed with the change that would close each one.

### Censorship resistance

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Static export served from Swarm/ENS with relative paths; no app server to take down | Met |
| Indexer failover list, with chain reads as the fallback for core data | Met |
| RPC failover across several providers, all reached through anon-rpc | Met |
| Indexer runs on a single AWS account | Gap: publish the indexer image and config so others can run mirrors, and list them in `indexerUrls` |
| The anon-rpc worker bundle is served from the resolvers the specifier owner lists | Gap, upstream: the specifier owner controls resolvers. We could publish our own specifier with extra resolvers |
| The default network's specifier (Nox) is on Sepolia and its node registry on Arbitrum Sepolia | Gap, upstream: testnet state can be reset. Nym and Tor (mainnet specifiers) are a one-line config switch, and `specifier` can point at a mainnet pin once Hisoka publishes one |
| Curator picks cannot keep an epoch closed: picks that are never served block that epoch's ballots in the agent's focus until the registry owner voids them (`voidCurations`), and then ballots open with rotation; a paused agent's picks are ignored. Published picks cannot be left off by the first preparer (no permissionless skip) | Partial: unblocking needs the owner within the epoch; an epoch left unprepared pays its fees to the default cause |
| Curator agents run on one account's scheduled routines with one key custodian (1Claw); only the registry owner registers signers | Gap: pins and rotation keep ballots working without the agents; the report schema and pick format are public, so an independent curator could be registered later |
| Curator data is free per epoch; x402 sells only packaged views of it | Met |

### Open source

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Dependencies are open source (anon-rpc is MIT) | Met |
| Varada's own code has no license file | **Gap: add a LICENSE at the repo root (choice pending)** |
| Builds are reproducible against the published Swarm hash | Gap: document the build-to-hash check |

### Privacy

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Chain reads via anon-rpc, per-account isolation, account reads fail closed | Met |
| No analytics, third-party fonts or WalletConnect relay | Met |
| Optional private routing for indexer traffic | Met |
| Ballot choices are hidden (Zama FHE scheme); voter and weight are public | Met; trust in Zama's threshold KMS. Interfold or a self-hosted scheme can replace it behind `IVotingScheme` |
| Zama relayer sees the voter's IP and address when encrypting a ballot | Gap: documented; `zamaRelayerUrl` allows an operator proxy |
| Transactions go through the wallet's RPC | Out of the app's control; documented above |
| No indexer ALB access logs, so client IPs and request paths are never stored (enforced by an infra test). The per-IP rate limiter keeps IPs only in memory, briefly | Met |
| Agent vault donors are named only on opt-in (`credit`); the indexer stores no address for the rest | Met; the donor address is public on chain regardless, documented above |
| x402 buyers need no account; nothing about a buyer is stored beyond the settlement | Met; the settlement itself is a public transfer from the payer's address |
| The indexer sees a paid request's IP and payer address together while serving it | Gap: documented; buyers can pay from a fresh address or route through Tor |
| Curator reports are public and permanent once referenced on chain | By design; they carry no personal data |

### Security

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| anon-rpc worker hash-pinned and sandboxed (null-origin iframe, no key access) | Met |
| Signing stays in the user's wallet; the anon worker never sees signed transactions | Met |
| Indexer CORS allowlist applied in prod (fixed: infra now sets `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, the variable the indexer reads) | Met |
| No Content Security Policy (static export cannot set headers) | Gap: add a `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">`; anon-rpc then needs `iframeUrl` pointing at a same-origin bootstrap page |
| Trust in the worker's read results | Gap: cross-check critical reads (for example, values a transaction depends on) against a second RPC |
| Curator keys live in 1Claw's HSM under per-agent policies (registry and own vault only, zero value, daily transaction cap, simulation) | Met |
| On-chain limits hold even if an agent key is misused: gifts only to unblocked orgs in the agent's own buckets, capped per epoch, no withdrawal; picks are checked against the catalogue at ballot time | Met |
| Human approval for large gifts is a 1Claw policy, enforced off chain | Gap: the on-chain `maxGivePerEpoch` is the hard limit; keep it at an amount the platform accepts losing to one bad week |
| Agents read untrusted news text (prompt injection) | Partial: the worst outcome, each epoch until it is paused, is skewed picks that (through an inflated weight) can also displace other agents' picks and rotation on tokens whose focus includes the agent's buckets, plus gifts up to the per-epoch cap. Holders still vote, and pausing stops both |
| Mainnet x402 settlement key can only call USDC `transferWithAuthorization` (1Claw policy and signer guard), only for the treasury as payee, only for the indexer's bearer token | Met |
