# Verada Architecture

Verada is a memecoin launchpad on Ethereum mainnet (chain id 1). Every token launches into a
Uniswap v4 pool paired with an approved quote asset (WETH or an Ondo token), with single-sided
liquidity that is locked permanently. Trading fees are consolidated to USDC and split between the
platform and a per-token cause pool. Each token chooses a cause focus at launch (categories such as
hunger or endangered species, and regions such as Africa), and its holders vote weekly, with hidden
choices, on which Endaoment-listed nonprofit inside that focus receives the accumulated cause funds. Every token gets an ENS subname
(`<label>.varada.eth`) with an editable profile and a page on the Swarm-hosted dApp.

A token can instead launch in live mode: every swap's fee is converted to USDC inside the swap and
donated to the cause active at that moment, and holders rotate that cause by private vote on a
period the creator picks (hourly to weekly); see [Live donation mode](#live-donation-mode).

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `contracts/` | Foundry project (solc 0.8.26, cancun). Dependencies under `contracts/lib` as git submodules. |
| `packages/sdk` | ABIs, addresses, viem helpers, fee math. |
| `packages/endaoment-client` | Typed Endaoment organization search client. |
| `packages/cause-catalog` | Harvests Endaoment orgs, classifies them by cause and region, and builds the catalogue Merkle tree (`verada-catalog` CLI). |
| `services/indexer` | Ponder indexer and API over protocol events. |
| `apps/web` | Next.js app built as a static export (token list, launch, token page, causes, governance). |
| `packages/publish` | Swarm upload, site feed updates and ENS contenthash tooling (dry-run by default). |
| `packages/arkiv-registry` | Arkiv entity schemas, reconcile planning and client for the token mirror. |
| `services/publisher` | Logo/metadata uploads to Swarm, stamp watch, Arkiv mirror and the tally keeper. |
| `infra/` | AWS CDK app. |

## Contracts

| Contract | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `VeradaToken` | ERC20 with permit, burn and vote checkpoints (ERC20Votes with a timestamp clock; holders are self-delegated on first receipt). Fixed supply minted to the factory. Immutable creator and metadata URI. |
| `VeradaFactory` | `deployToken`: deploys the token via CREATE2, registers its ENS label, logo and cause focus in the profile registry, initializes the v4 pool (token/quote, dynamic fee, Verada hook), mints single-sided liquidity through the position manager, sends the position NFT to the locker, and registers the token with the fee vault and governor. `deployLiveToken` runs the same launch on the live hook and registers the token with the live vault and rotation governor instead. |
| `QuoteRegistry` | Owner-managed allowlist of quote assets. |
| `FeeConsolidator` | Swaps collected fees into USDC through Uniswap v4 before the split. |
| `TokenProfileRegistry` | Per-token profile: ENS label, controller and editor roles, text records, logo reference, contenthash override, suppression flag, and the cause focus (category and region masks, written once at launch). Factory-written at launch; the takeover governor may replace a controller. |
| `VeradaResolver` | Stateless ENSIP-10 wildcard resolver for `varada.eth`: answers `addr`, `text`, `contenthash` for every `<label>.varada.eth` from the registry. |
| `TakeoverGovernor` | Community takeover votes that replace a token's profile controller. |
| `ZamaVotingScheme` | `IVotingScheme` implementation that hides ballot choices with Zama FHEVM and reveals only aggregates. |
| `VeradaHook` | Uniswap v4 hook. Sets the dynamic fee (base fee plus a decaying anti-sniper surcharge) and routes collected fees to the fee vault. |
| `VeradaLpLocker` | Holds liquidity position NFTs permanently. Principal can never be withdrawn; only accrued fees are collected and forwarded to the fee vault. |
| `FeeVault` | Splits incoming fees between platform and cause pool; tracks balances per token; releases a token's cause pool for an epoch once a winner exists. |
| `CauseCatalog` | Owner-published, versioned Merkle root over every eligible Endaoment org, bucketed by `category x region`, with per-bucket sizes and the Swarm reference of the snapshot. A version applies to epochs starting after it is set. |
| `CauseRegistry` | Causes that can be paid: `causeId` (`keccak256` of the 32-byte Endaoment org id) to the org's factory-computed address and an active flag. The governor materializes catalogue winners into it; the owner can add causes directly or block any org. |
| `EpochGovernor` | Weekly epochs. Builds each epoch's ballot from the token's pinned causes and rotation draws over its focus pool, authorizes voters by vote checkpoints, and records the winning cause from the scheme's tally on finalization. |
| `DonationDistributor` | After finalization, sends the epoch's cause funds to the winning cause's payout address. |
| `VeradaLiveHook` | Uniswap v4 hook of live tokens. Takes the fee from every swap in the quote currency, converts it to USDC inside the same swap and credits it to the cause active at that moment; a failed conversion holds the fee for a permissionless retry instead of reverting the swap. No owner. |
| `LiveDonationVault` | USDC ledger of live tokens: splits every conversion 10% platform / 90% cause, keeps the cause share per `(token, cause)` and pushes it to the cause's Endaoment org once the token's donation threshold is reached, or on `flush`. |
| `RotationGovernor` | Live tokens' rotation schedule (anchor-based, period chosen at launch, changeable by vote), the private rotation polls that pick the next cause, and the private yes/no polls that change the period. |
| `IPrivateDonationAdapter` | Interface only; see Deferred work. |

### Fee model

- The pool LP fee is dynamic and set per token at launch, between 1% and 5%, plus an optional
  anti-sniper surcharge that decays to zero over a short window after launch.
- Collected fees are split by `FeeVault` using a single constant, `PLATFORM_SHARE_BPS = 1000`:
  - 10% goes to the platform treasury.
  - 90% goes to the token's cause pool.
- Basis-point math uses a denominator of 10,000 and rounds in favor of the cause pool. The split is
  defined in one place only and is never duplicated elsewhere.

```
swap -> VeradaHook (dynamic fee) -> FeeVault
LP fees -> VeradaLpLocker.collectFees -> FeeVault
FeeVault --10%--> platform treasury
FeeVault --90%--> causePool[token] --settle(epoch winner)--> DonationDistributor --> cause payout
```

### Weekly epoch governance (hidden choices)

This is the weekly mode; the live counterpart is [Live rotation governance](#live-rotation-governance-hidden-choices).

- Epochs last 7 days. Epoch 0 starts at a Thursday 00:00 UTC boundary at or before deployment.
- A token's focus is fixed at launch: a set of catalogue categories and a set of regions. Its pool
  is every catalogue entry in those `category x region` buckets, under the catalogue version in
  effect when the epoch starts. The factory rejects a focus whose pool has fewer than two entries.
- Each epoch's ballot holds up to 32 causes (`EpochGovernor.ballotSize`). The token's controller may
  pin up to 8 catalogue orgs inside the focus (with Merkle proofs); pins lead the ballot and change
  from the next epoch once the current ballot is prepared. The remaining slots are filled by
  rotation: draw `k` is pool entry `keccak256(abi.encode(token, epoch, version, k)) % poolSize`,
  skipping repeats (an org in several buckets) and blocked orgs, for at most three draws per free
  slot; a pool that fits the free slots is taken whole, in order. Nobody can choose the draws, and
  over time every charity in the focus reaches a ballot.
- Anyone may fix the ballot with `prepareBallot(token, epoch, draws)`, supplying each drawn entry
  and its proof; the publisher's keeper does this at the start of every epoch from the indexer's
  catalogue. A ballot that needs no draws opens with `openEpoch(token, epoch)`. Ballots are
  rejected until the epoch is opened, so a ballot's option index always refers to the frozen
  `epochOptions`. A ballot of fewer than two options opens no poll and the epoch pays the
  default cause.
- Voting weight is the holder's `VeradaToken.getPastVotes` one second before the epoch start,
  counted in whole tokens. In the epoch a token launches in, that time predates the token, so its
  weights are read at a launch snapshot one day after registration instead (halfway to the
  epoch's end when less than two days remain; `snapshotFor`, `launchSnapshotOf`). The voter and
  weight are public; the choice is not.
- Ballots go to the voting scheme directly (`IVotingScheme.castBallot(governor, token, epoch,
  ballot)`), because encrypted inputs are bound to the transaction sender. The scheme calls back
  `EpochGovernor.authorizeBallot`, which checks eligibility, records the voter and emits `VoteCast`.
- `ZamaVotingScheme` packs three 40-bit counters into each encrypted `euint128` word (11 words for
  32 options) and adds the voter's weight to the counter their encrypted index selects, touching
  every word so nothing reveals the choice; one 32-option ballot costs about 971k gas of FHE work. After the epoch, `closeEpoch` makes the tallies publicly
  decryptable; the publisher's tally keeper fetches the decryption and KMS proof from Zama's relayer
  and calls `submitTally`, which verifies the proof on-chain. `finalizeEpoch` then stores the
  winning `causeId` (ties go to the lowest ballot index; an epoch without ballots falls back to the
  owner-set default cause) and materializes a catalogue winner into `CauseRegistry` from the
  Endaoment factory's `computeOrgAddress`. If no verified tally arrives within two weeks of the epoch's end, the
  epoch also falls back to the default cause, so a cause pool can never be stranded. The fee vault
  settles that epoch's cause pool to `DonationDistributor`.
- The scheme is pluggable per governor. Interfold (CRISP) or a self-hosted Noir/Barretenberg scheme
  can replace Zama without changing the governors.

### Community takeover

Holders can replace an absent or unwanted profile controller. `TakeoverGovernor.propose` needs a
minimum token age, a per-proposer cooldown and a proposer weight above a threshold; it opens a
two-option poll (AGAINST, FOR) on the scheme. Several proposals for one token may run at once;
executing one supersedes the older ones. Voting weight is the smaller of a holder's votes at the
snapshot (the second before the proposal) and at `lookback` earlier (one week by default), so
tokens bought for a single block carry no weight. Quorum and threshold are basis points of the
circulating supply at the snapshot, which excludes the Uniswap pool manager's locked balance.
After the voting period the proposal is closed and tallied; it succeeds when FOR reaches the
quorum and beats AGAINST, and `execute` within the execution window (at least two days, to leave
room for decryption) calls `TokenProfileRegistry.setController`. Only the proposer, or the owner
while voting is still open, may cancel.

Key events consumed by the indexer and SDK: `TokenCreated`, `FeesCollected`, `CauseAdded`,
`CauseDeactivated`, `CatalogVersionSet`, `FocusSet`, `BallotPrepared`, `EpochOpened`, `EpochClosed`,
`EpochFinalized`, `Donated`, `VoteCast`,
`TokenRegistered`, `ControllerChanged`, `EditorChanged`, `TextChanged`, `ContenthashChanged`,
`LogoChanged`, the scheme's `PollOpened`/`BallotCast`/`TallyRequested`/`TallySubmitted` and the
takeover governor's `TakeoverProposed`/`TakeoverVoteCast`/`TakeoverTallied`/`TakeoverExecuted`.

### Deferred work

- **Trust-minimised private voting**: Zama's threshold KMS is the day-zero trust anchor. Interfold's
  CRISP (bonded ciphernode network) is the intended replacement once its voting program reaches
  mainnet; a self-hosted Noir/Barretenberg scheme (exponential ElGamal ballots, k-of-n committee
  decryption) was researched as the fallback. Both plug into `IVotingScheme`.
- **Private donations** are deferred. `IPrivateDonationAdapter` defines the shielded send route, with
  no implementation yet. Donations currently go directly to the cause payout address.
- **Arkiv mainnet**: the mirror runs against the Rabdi testnet until Arkiv ships a mainnet.
- **Catalogue on Arkiv**: Arkiv mirrors each token's focus, not the catalogue itself. Mirroring
  catalogue versions and per-org entries needs indexer listings for them and a measure of Arkiv
  write throughput and lifetime-extension cost for a few hundred thousand entities.
- **Preparing a ballot from the web app**: the keeper prepares ballots; the dApp only shows that a
  ballot is not prepared yet.

## Live donation mode

Live mode is the second way to launch a token. A weekly token accrues a cause pool that holders
assign once a week; a live token donates as it trades. The creator picks the mode at launch
(`VeradaFactory.deployLiveToken` instead of `deployToken`); it cannot be changed afterwards. The
token, its ENS name, its profile, the locked single-sided liquidity, the takeover governor and the
10% / 90% split are the same in both modes.

| | Weekly mode | Live mode |
|---|---|---|
| Hook | `VeradaHook` | `VeradaLiveHook` |
| Fee to USDC | Collected, then consolidated by `FeeConsolidator` | Converted inside the trader's swap |
| Ledger | `FeeVault` cause pool per token | `LiveDonationVault` credit per `(token, cause)` |
| Payout | Once per epoch, to the winner, through `DonationDistributor` | Continuously, to the cause active when the fee was earned |
| Governor | `EpochGovernor`, 7-day epochs | `RotationGovernor`, 1 h / 12 h / 24 h / 72 h / 7 d rotations |
| No result | Default cause | Current cause continues |
| Revealed | Per-option tallies | Winning option only |

### Launch and focus

- `deployLiveToken(params, live)` takes the same `DeployParams` as `deployToken` plus
  `LiveParams`: `initialCause` (an active `CauseRegistry` cause, which receives fees from launch),
  `rotationPeriod` and `donationThreshold`.
- Launch focus rule: both modes fix the token's cause focus (category and region masks) at launch,
  forever, under the same catalogue check: the latest catalogue must give the focus at least two
  entries, or the launch reverts (`IEpochGovernor.PoolTooSmall`). A weekly token is checked when the
  epoch governor registers it; a live token never reaches that governor, so the factory runs the
  same check itself.
- Live mode is enabled once by the factory's deployer with `configureLiveMode(liveHook,
  liveVault)`; until then `deployLiveToken` reverts `LiveModeNotConfigured`. The live hook must
  differ from the weekly hook and report the live vault as its vault.

### In-swap conversion and donation

- The pool's LP fee is overridden to 0, so the locked position earns nothing. The hook takes the fee
  itself: base fee (1% to 5%) plus the decaying launch surcharge, at most 85% of the swap's gross
  quote flow, rounded up. It is taken from the input or the output depending on which side of the
  swap is the quote currency; exact-input buys and exact-output sells must fill completely
  (`PartialFillNotSupported`).
- In `afterSwap` the hook mints itself ERC-6909 claims for the fee and, unless the router has a
  currency synced mid-settlement, makes a gas-capped self call (`inlineConvert`, 650k gas) that has
  the consolidator burn the claims and swap them to USDC along the quote's hookless registry route
  (at most three hops, including the WETH unwrap), under the consolidator's tighter in-swap price
  guards. The USDC is paid to `LiveDonationVault` and credited to the cause `RotationGovernor`
  reports as active at that moment (`FeeTaken(token, causeId, rotation, ..., converted, failure)`).
- Nothing about the conversion or the donation can revert a trader's swap. If the conversion fails
  (a route pool pushed off its reference, a synced currency, out of gas), the frame is rolled back
  and the claims stay with the hook as `heldRaw[token][cause]`, attributed to the cause active when
  they were earned. Anyone can convert them later with `retryHeld(token, causeId, amount)`; the
  credit still goes to that cause (`HeldRetried`, and `Credited` with rotation `type(uint64).max`).
- The only reverts the hook adds to a swap are `InsufficientGas`, `PartialFillNotSupported` and
  `SwapReentered`. `PoolManager.donate` to a live pool always reverts (`DonateNotAllowed`), since
  the locked position could never collect it.

### LiveDonationVault and the donation threshold

- Every credit is split once: `floor(gross * 1000 / 10000)` to the platform, the rest to the
  `(token, cause)` bucket. Credit never moves between causes; a cause rotated out keeps its bucket
  until it is paid.
- Each token has a donation threshold in USDC (6 decimals, at most 1,000,000 USDC), chosen at
  launch. When a bucket's credit reaches it, the vault pushes the whole bucket to the cause's
  Endaoment org inside the same swap, through a gas-capped self call (`executePush`, 220k gas). A
  threshold of 0 pushes on every swap.
- The UI should default to a nonzero threshold. A push inside a swap adds about 120k to 150k gas to
  that trader's swap (Endaoment registry lookup, address and active checks, approve, donate). With
  threshold 0 every trader pays it; with a threshold, only the swap that crosses it does, and the
  donations are larger and fewer.
- A push only goes to a deployed, Endaoment-active org. Any failure (undeployed or inactive org,
  address mismatch, paused USDC, out of gas) keeps the credit, sets a one-hour backoff on that
  bucket and emits `DonationDeferred`. `flush(token, causeId)` sends a bucket at any time, ignoring
  the threshold and backoff, and deploys the org through the Endaoment factory if needed.
- `withdrawPlatform` and `skim` are permissionless and only ever pay the platform treasury; `skim`
  never touches owed USDC. The vault has no pause, redirect or rescue. Its invariant is
  `usdc.balanceOf(vault) >= platformAccrued + totalPending`.

```
swap -> VeradaLiveHook (fee in quote) --inlineConvert--> FeeConsolidator (route to USDC) --> LiveDonationVault
LiveDonationVault --10%--> platform treasury
LiveDonationVault --90%--> pending[token][activeCause] --threshold reached or flush--> Endaoment org
conversion failed -> heldRaw[token][activeCause] --retryHeld--> FeeConsolidator --> LiveDonationVault
```

### Live rotation governance (hidden choices)

- Periods: one hour, 12 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours or one week (`RotationPeriod`). The creator picks
  one at launch; holders can change it by vote (below).
- Schedule: anchor-based (`RotationScheduleLib`). Rotation 0 starts at launch, and rotation `n`
  covers `[startOf(n), startOf(n + 1))`, counted from the anchor rather than from
  `block.timestamp / period`. A period change only ever applies from the next boundary, so past and
  current rotations are never renumbered, the start of the current and next rotation never move,
  and poll scopes and snapshots never collide across a change.
- During rotation `c`, holders vote on the cause for rotation `c + 1`. The poll opens at
  `startOf(c)` and closes `min(period / 4, 6 hours)` before rotation `c + 1` starts, leaving that
  buffer to close, decrypt and finalize: 15 minutes for hourly rotations, 3 hours for 12-hour
  rotations, 6 hours for longer ones. `openRound(token)` is permissionless.
- Keep-current: a winner applies from the rotation after the one in which it is finalized, never
  retroactively, so a result that arrives late applies one boundary later. With no ballots, fewer
  than `minVoters` ballots (nothing is decrypted then), no option with weight, or no result yet,
  the current cause simply keeps receiving fees. There is no fallback cause in live mode. A winner
  that is no longer active in `CauseRegistry` is recorded as `InactiveWinner` and changes nothing.
  Rounds are plurality with no quorum; ties go to the lowest option index.
- Weights: a voter's weight is the lowest vote checkpoint it held over the whole hold window
  `[snapshot - lookback, snapshot]`, with `snapshot = startOf(c) - 1` and `lookback = max(period,
  1 day)`, in whole tokens. Tokens bought during the rotation carry nothing, and a position held
  only around the public snapshot instant carries nothing either (no buy-vote-sell, flash loans or
  one-block holds). Polls in a token's first day therefore carry no weight.
- Privacy: polls run on the same pluggable `IVotingScheme` (`ZamaVotingScheme`), but are closed
  with `requestOutcome`, which computes the argmax under FHE and makes only the winning option index
  publicly decryptable. Per-option tallies are never decrypted: in small polls whose voters and
  weights are public, they would give individual choices away.
- Period changes: any holder whose hold weight meets the proposal threshold may
  `proposePeriod(token, newPeriod)` (not in rotation 0). It opens a private yes/no poll; quorum is
  a share of the circulating supply at the snapshot (total supply minus the pool manager's
  balance). Only the outcome is revealed (`PeriodProposalTallied(id, passed)`; FOR wins with
  `for > against` and `for >= quorum`), and a passed proposal executed within its window schedules
  the new period from the next boundary. One proposal per token and period may be active, so
  proposals for different periods run side by side. Defeats and expiries start a cooldown for that
  period; an execution starts it for every period and supersedes older pending proposals. The
  deploy defaults are a one-day vote, a three-day execution window, a seven-day cooldown, 10%
  quorum and a 0.5% proposal threshold.

### Live ballot candidates

Live rotation polls draw their candidates the same way weekly epochs do, over the token's focus
pool, so a live token's causes always come from its launch focus:

1. **Pins.** The controller's catalogue pins inside the focus (with Merkle proofs) lead the ballot.
2. **Curated picks.** The curator agents' current curations for the focus buckets fill part of the
   remaining slots, with the same weighted quotas and pick checks as a weekly ballot.
3. **Rotation.** Deterministic draws over the focus pool fill the rest: draw `k` is pool entry
   `keccak256(abi.encode(token, target, version, k)) % poolSize`, skipping repeats and blocked orgs
   under the same draw budget, so nobody can choose them.

The options are frozen when the round is prepared, before its first ballot, so an option index
always refers to a list fixed by an earlier transaction, and pins or curations changed later apply
from the next round. Blocked orgs are skipped in every phase. A catalogue winner is materialized
into `CauseRegistry` with the Endaoment factory's computed address before it receives fees. The
round size is the governor's ballot size, further capped by the scheme.

This replaces the first version's per-token shortlist of `CauseRegistry` causes set by the
controller (with an owner-set default shortlist), which the contracts are moving away from.

Key live events: the factory's `LiveModeConfigured`; the hook's `TokenConfigured`,
`PoolRegistered`, `FeeTaken`, `HeldRetried`; the vault's `LiveTokenRegistered`, `Credited`,
`Donated`, `DonationDeferred`, `PlatformWithdrawn`, `Skimmed`; the governor's `TokenRegistered`,
`RoundOpened`, `RotationVoteCast`, `RoundClosed`, `RoundFinalized`, `CauseScheduled`,
`PeriodProposed`, `PeriodVoteCast`, `PeriodProposalClosed`, `PeriodProposalTallied`,
`PeriodProposalExpired`, `PeriodChangeScheduled`, `PeriodProposalCanceled`.

### Live mode operator notes

- **Swap gas.** A swap that owes a fee needs `LIVE_GAS_REQUIRED` (770,317) gas left at
  `afterSwap`, or it reverts `InsufficientGas` rather than silently skipping the donation. In
  practice that is a gas limit of about 0.86M to 0.89M per swap, of which the swap uses about 0.29M
  (no push) to 0.40M (push in the swap); the rest is refunded. The requirement does not depend on
  state, so `eth_estimateGas` finds it.
- **Aggregators and routers.** An integrator that sizes the gas limit from a simulation of the
  swap's actual usage, or forwards a fixed per-hop budget, can leave too little at `afterSwap` and
  hit `InsufficientGas`. Live pools need the full limit above; tell integrators so.
- **Hourly periods.** The poll closes 15 minutes before the next rotation. In that window the
  keeper must call `closeRound`, have the outcome decrypted through Zama's relayer and call
  `finalizeRound`; anything later applies one rotation late. Watch hourly tokens closely.
- **First fee of a new WETH-quoted pool.** It may be held rather than converted (`FeeTaken` with
  `converted = false`). It stays attributed to the cause active when it was earned; call
  `retryHeld` (or let the keeper do it) to convert it. Watch `totalHeld` and `heldRaw`.
- **Deferred pushes.** `DonationDeferred` buckets retry inside a swap after the one-hour backoff;
  `flush` pays them now and deploys an undeployed org.

## Token profiles and ENS subnames

Every launch registers a label in `TokenProfileRegistry`; `<label>.varada.eth` exists exactly when
the token exists, with no per-name ENS transaction. `varada.eth` is registered on ENSv2 and its
resolver is `VeradaResolver`, an ENSIP-10 wildcard resolver that the Universal Resolver reaches
for every subname. Records: `addr` is the token address and can never change; `contenthash` is the
registry's default (the dApp's Swarm feed manifest) unless the controller sets an override; text
records (`url`, `description`, `avatar`, `com.twitter`, `org.telegram`, `com.discord`) are edited by
the controller or an appointed editor; `verada.logo` is synthesized from the on-chain logo
reference. The registry owner can reserve labels and suppress a profile (the resolver then answers
empty values while the label stays taken).

## Arkiv mirror

`services/publisher` reconciles the indexer's view of tokens and causes into Arkiv entities
(`verada.token` core records made read-only with burned ownership, `verada.token-profile` records
owned by the platform key and patched when records change on mainnet, `verada.cause` records) so
other chains and apps can query the token list. Since schema version 2 the core record carries the
token's cause focus: `causeCategory` and `causeRegion` hold comma-wrapped slug lists
(`,hunger,children-youth,`, or `*` for every category or region) so one cause or region can be
matched with a glob, next to the raw `categoryMask` and `regionMask`. Readers must check `$creator` equals the platform
address; the schema tag alone is spoofable. Entities expire after at most 182 days, so the mirror
also extends them. Mainnet remains the source of truth.

## Endaoment integration

Causes are sourced from Endaoment. `packages/endaoment-client` wraps the organization search API
with typed responses, runtime validation, pagination, retries and an injectable cache. Image URLs in
API responses are ignored.

### Cause catalogue

Every compliant Endaoment org with a mainnet address is eligible, without a transaction per org:

1. **Harvest** (`verada-catalog harvest`): the search API is crawled one NTEE major group at a time
   (about 250k orgs in November 2026), checkpointed and resumable. Endaoment bans an IP for about
   ten minutes after a 429, so the crawl is throttled and backs off in minutes; for the full crawl,
   ask Endaoment for a workload-specific rate limit.
2. **Classify** (`verada-catalog build`): the shared taxonomy (`packages/sdk/src/catalog.ts`, 21
   categories and 8 regions) maps specific NTEE codes to categories. Name and description keywords
   classify orgs whose code is missing, unclassified (`Z`), major-group-only or international
   (`Q*`), which covers most non-US orgs. A few high-precision phrases apply to every org whatever
   its code: "innocence project", "wrongful conviction" or "exoneration" place an org in Justice &
   the wrongly accused even when it is filed as civil rights or left unclassified. Regions come from the HQ country; international (`Q*`)
   orgs also get Global and any region their text names. Endaoment only reports an org's HQ, not
   where it works, so `packages/cause-catalog/region-overrides.json` holds curated corrections.
   Orgs nothing places land in `other`.
3. **Tree**: an org appears once in every `category x region` bucket it belongs to, ordered by org
   id; leaves are OpenZeppelin standard-tree leaves of `(uint16 bucket, uint32 index, bytes32 orgId)`.
4. **Publish**: the snapshot (`catalog.json`, `orgs.jsonl`, `tree.json`) is uploaded to Swarm
   (`verada-catalog publish`), and the owner signs `CauseCatalog.setVersion(root, bucketSizes,
   swarmRef)` (`verada-catalog calldata` prints it; the keeper key never sets roots). The indexer
   loads the snapshot (`CATALOG_SOURCE`) and serves `/api/catalog`, `/search`, `/pool`, `/entries`
   (with proofs), `/causes` and `/orgs/:id`.

Only the winner of an epoch is written to `CauseRegistry`, with the address the Endaoment factory
computes for its org id, which the distributor checks again before paying. The registry owner can
block any org (`blockOrg`): a blocked org is skipped by rotation, cannot be pinned and is never
reactivated by materialization. When a new catalogue version drops an org, block it too.

## Hosting model

There is no web server. The frontend is a static export published to Ethereum Swarm and reached
through ENS: `varada.eth` and every `<label>.varada.eth` resolve to the same contenthash, a Swarm
feed manifest that the publish tool points at the latest release. The always-on services are the
indexer with its Postgres database, the Bee node with its gateway (uploads), and the publisher, all
on AWS.

```
browser --ENS name--> gateway (eth.limo, bzz.link) --contenthash (feed manifest)--> Swarm feed --> release manifest --> static files
   |     (hostname label -> token page; `verada.com/<label>` for the plain-DNS deployment)
   |--HTTPS JSON + SSE--> indexer (ALB -> ECS Fargate) --> Postgres
   |--HTTPS multipart----> publisher (uploads: logo, metadata) --> swarm-gateway --> Bee light node
   |--JSON-RPC (anon-rpc transports)--> Ethereum node   (chain reads fallback, and all wallet writes)
```

### Static frontend

- `apps/web` uses `output: "export"`. Every route is pre-rendered; the token page is a single
  static route that reads the address from the query string, so no route depends on a server.
- All asset references are relative so the same files work under a subdomain gateway and a
  `/bzz/<ref>/` path gateway. No binary assets are shipped; `verify:export` and the publish tool
  both reject them.
- Runtime settings (indexer URLs, RPC URL, chain id, contract addresses) come from `config.json` in
  the bundle, with build-time defaults from `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`. They are public values; no secrets.
  Changing indexer URLs therefore needs a new Swarm reference and a contenthash update.
- Swarm content is immutable per reference. A release is: build, validate, upload, append the new
  reference to the site feed (`verada-publish feed-update`). The contenthash points at the feed
  manifest and does not change. The previous reference stays addressable while its stamp lasts.

### Swarm and ENS contenthash

- `packages/publish` validates the export, estimates stamp depth and cost, uploads through a Bee
  node (only with `--execute`), and encodes the reference as an ENS contenthash.
- Encoding is ENSIP-7 / EIP-1577 for Swarm: `0xe40101fa011b20` followed by the 32-byte reference
  (swarm-ns, CIDv1, swarm-manifest, keccak-256, 32 bytes). The tool prints the exact calldata, either
  `TokenProfileRegistry.setDefaultContenthash(bytes)` for the Verada resolver or
  `setContenthash(bytes32,bytes)` for a standard resolver; it never signs or sends it.
- Postage stamps (xBZZ on Gnosis Chain) and the ENS transaction are paid by the operator. Content
  expires when its stamp does, so the batch must be topped up.
- The `publish-swarm` workflow only builds, validates and attaches the export as a build artifact.
  It holds no keys, stamp or ENS credentials; upload and the contenthash update are manual.

### Indexer API

The indexer exposes JSON over HTTPS with CORS, cursor pagination and bigint values as decimal
strings: `/health`, `/api/tokens` (rows now carry `name`, `symbol` and the ENS profile columns
`label`, `controller`, `editor`, `logoRef`, `contenthash`, `suppressed`), `/api/tokens/:address`
(plus `profile` with text records, `shortlist` (pinned causes) and `focus`), `/api/tokens/by-label/:label`,
`/api/activity` (filterable, newest first; kinds include `token_registered`, `profile_updated`,
`epoch_opened`, `epoch_closed`, `takeover_proposed`, `takeover_executed`, `tally_submitted`),
`/api/activity/stream` (Server-Sent Events with `Last-Event-ID` resume), `/api/causes`,
`/api/causes/search` (cached server-side proxy of Endaoment search, never returning image URLs),
`/api/epochs/:token[/:epoch]` (with the frozen `options`, the scheme `poll` state and counts, `start`,
`end`, `snapshot`), `/api/takeovers/:token[/:id]` (proposals with a derived `state`),
`/api/polls/:governor/:token/:scope` and `/api/stats` (USDC totals, 6 decimals). There is no route
keyed by voter address.

### Data flow

1. Contracts emit events on mainnet. The indexer ingests them over RPC into Postgres.
2. The browser loads the static bundle from Swarm, reads `config.json`, and calls the indexer for
   lists, activity, causes and stats, and subscribes to the activity stream.
3. If the indexer is unreachable, the app falls back to reading the chain directly through
   wagmi/viem for the core views, using the configured RPC.
4. Writes (launch, vote, donate) are transactions from the user's wallet; the indexer is read-only
   from the browser's point of view.
5. The cause picker queries the indexer's Endaoment proxy, so the browser never calls Endaoment or
   loads its images.

### CORS and gateways

The indexer only answers listed origins (`indexerCorsOrigins` in CDK, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in the
service). A Swarm site is served from the origin of whichever gateway is used, for example an
ENS-gateway hostname for the name, so each gateway origin you intend to support must be listed.
Production does not allow `*`. The API is rate limited per client.

### Intentionally not decentralised yet

- The indexer is a single operator-run AWS service. It is a convenience and performance layer, not
  a source of truth: the chain is, and the frontend can read it directly. Anyone can run their own
  indexer and point `config.json` at it (multiple indexer URLs are tried in order).
- The ENS name is controlled by one account, which decides what the contenthash points to.
- Postage stamps are bought and renewed by the operator; availability depends on them.
- Gateways used to open the ENS name are third-party; users who run their own Bee node and ENS
  resolution avoid them.
- RPC access defaults to one configured endpoint.
- The Endaoment search proxy is operated by the indexer host.

## AWS topology

Defined in `infra/` with CDK (TypeScript). The indexer, the Bee node with its gateway and the
publisher live on AWS; there are no web hosting resources (no S3 site bucket, CloudFront or web
service).

| Stack | Resources |
|---|---|
| `NetworkStack` | VPC across two availability zones with a no-NAT default network and optional private egress. |
| `DataStack` | PostgreSQL for the indexer: RDS (dev default) or Aurora Serverless v2 (prod default), credentials in Secrets Manager. |
| `IndexerStack` | ECR repository, ECS Fargate service behind an Application Load Balancer that must terminate HTTPS, autoscaling, log groups. |
| `SwarmStack` | Bee light node (`ethersphere/bee`) with its data directory on EFS plus `swarm-gateway` (public reads, authenticated uploads) behind an HTTPS ALB. |
| `PublisherStack` | ECR repository and Fargate service for `services/publisher` behind an HTTPS ALB. |
| `ObservabilityStack` | Alarms and a dashboard for the services and database. |

Stack ids are `Verada-<env>-<Name>`. Configuration comes from CDK context and Secrets Manager; no
secrets live in code, and IAM is least-privilege. `cdk synth` runs offline in CI with dummy context.

## CI and deployment

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Foundry format, build and test; pnpm install, typecheck and test; a
  static export job (publish tool tests, web tests, export build, export validation, upload dry run
  that sends nothing); an infra job (typecheck, jest, `cdk synth` with dummy context and no AWS
  credentials); and a check that no binary asset files are tracked.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml`: manual dispatch. Deploys only the network, data, indexer and
  observability stacks for a chosen environment name. It assumes an AWS role through GitHub OIDC
  (no long-lived keys) and needs the repository variables `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `AWS_REGION` and
  `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_NAME`, plus non-secret settings such as the indexer domain or certificate,
  allowed CORS origins and contract addresses.
- `.github/workflows/publish-swarm.yml`: manual dispatch. Builds and validates the static export and
  attaches it (with the dry-run report) as a build artifact. It has read-only repository access, no
  secrets, and never uploads to Swarm or touches ENS.
